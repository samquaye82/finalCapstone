# Unsupervised Machine Learning

### About

Welcome to my project on unsupervised machine learning where I apply machine learning techniques to US Arrest data. The aim of the project was to analyse the public data and come up with observations about the subjects in the data.


### Instructions

All the necessary code is contained in a jupyter notebook. In order to access the project you will need to have an IDE that incorporates jupyter or alternatively download the Anaconda navigator and get access to Jupyter through that. 

The relevant instructions for how to do that can be found here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
